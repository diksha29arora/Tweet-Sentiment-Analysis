# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

I implemented this project during my workshop on Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing. The project is aimed at analyzing the sentiment of tweets using NLP and Deep Learning. It's trained on the Sentiment140 dataset with 1.6 Million tweets. I've used LSTM based neural network to train my model for Sentiment Analysis.
