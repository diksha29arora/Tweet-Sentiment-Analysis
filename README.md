# Tweeter-Sentiment-Analysis

I've build this project during my workshop on Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing. This is a Sentimental Analysis project where I'm analyze the sentiment of tweets using NLP and Deep Learning. It's trained on the Sentiment140 dataset with 1.6Million tweets. I've used LSTM based neural network to train my model for Sentiment Analysis.
